# Installing Raspbian

Please consult an [outside source](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/). Much has already been written about installing raspbian onto an sd card for use with raspberry pis. This process is called 'flashing' because you're writing onto a flash chip. Please note that you must complete the next section before you eject the SD card.

# Before you eject the sd card

Once you have your sd card with raspbian, open the sd card in the file explorer and add a file called 'wpa_supplicant.conf'. Copy and paste the following into it.
```
country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
	ssid="MyWiFiNetwork"
	psk="aVeryStrongPassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

Additionally, create a blank file called 'ssh' (with no file extension) so that you can access the device remotely and without a keyboard and monitor.

Next, go to the ```/boot/config.txt``` files and add this to the bottom:
```
dtoverlay=dwc2
```
Finally, open the ```cmdline.txt```  Each parameter is seperated by a single space, and it does not use newlines. Insert modules-load=dwc2,g_ether after rootwait.

Then, if you are on Windows install PuTTY. It allows you to talk to Unix/Linux computers. Once that is installed, you should be able to ssh into the hostname 'raspberry pi' using port '22' and the ssh protocol. The command is:

# Connecting and First Time Setup

```
ssh pi@raspberrypi
```
Once you login with the default password of 'raspberry,' run

```
sudo raspi-config
```

This command runs a utility for configuring raspberry pis. The sudo part means you want to do it as administrator. On Linux, the administrator account is called 'root' or 'superuser'. ```sudo``` means 'do as superuser' or 'SuperUserDO'. First, change your root password. Then, change your hostname. In the advanced configuration menu, set the memory allocation to 256, expand the filesystem, and change the resolution to 1024 * 768.  

Reboot.

Once you've connected again, we're going to install some software. Here we'll use aptitude to install software. On Linux, there are a variety of ways to install software. This is the most reliable way for raspbian, the flavor of linux that our raspberry pi runs. The command is



```
sudo apt-get install ufw
```

That installs a firewall and below sets it up. Ports allow your computer to send traffic to individual applications. Please google these ports to see what each one is for.

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 8080
sudo ufw allow 443
sudo ufw allow 587
sudo ufw allow 22
```

Now that our pi is all set up, it's about time for a break. On linux, you have to update most software manually. It's a good idea to do the below before attempting to install anything using the ```apt``` command.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```

# Networking

```
sudo apt isntall dnsmasq hostapd
```

TODO: This section needs to be fleshed out
